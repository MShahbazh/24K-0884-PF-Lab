/* Question #4
A car travelled back and forth from point A to point B. With a distance being (single trip)
1207KM. During the forward trip fuel price was 118/liter while returning it was 123/liter.
Calculate the total fuel cost (both ways) and the fuel consumed (total trip). Use the carâ€™s fuel
average as input from the user (Input must be positive make some restrictions on only accepting
positive input) */
